My background is in computer science and math, which led me to my day job of a technology strategist focusing on Agile and DevSecOps and a major defense contractor. A huge part of my job is also getting to mentor college students in cybersecurity and general careers. When I'm not doing either of these things, you can find me on a hiking trail, baking \"healthy\" cookies, in a dance studio, or amateurly playing the drums.\n<br><br>\n#### Currently\nAt [&TECH](https://www.andtechnology.org), I spent 2020 putting together an amazing team of high school interns, strategic advisors, engineers, and more, who also happen to be great friends. We are setting out to host Frederick, MD's very first high school-focused hackathon, Hack&TECH, in summer of 2021. I am currently putting together tech-related resources for the community to have access to, working with my team on communications and ideation for the future, and planning and prototyping &TECH Challenges for three interdisciplinary tracks: art&TECH, sports&TECH, and music&TECH. Check out our work at www.andtechnology.org!\n<br><br>\nAt my day job, I am working Digital Transformation for a major defense contractor. After spending time doing software development and cybersecurity, I took a leap of faith to be on the cutting edge of good and innovative change for the company. This past year, I've learned a ton about and applied a ton of [DevSecOps](https://www.alldaydevops.com/), Lean-Agile, Model-based Engineering, web development, [Dojos](https://dojoconsortium.org/), and so much more. Even amidst the new virtual environment, I was fortunate enough to be able to continue serving as a mentor for the [UMD ACES CyberConnect Program](https://aces.umd.edu/cyberconnect) and mentored the 2020 winning team of [UMBC's annual CyPi Competition](https://my3.my.umbc.edu/groups/issa/posts/94169).\n<br><br>\nLast but not least, I am a dance teacher at [BJCDA](https://www.bjcda.com/), where I have danced since I was five years old. I teach and choreograph jazz and ballet dances for several awesome classes, and take my own tap, ballet, jazz, and lyrical classes, which I obviously have yet to grow tired of. We are looking forward to our 61st BJCDA Dance Recital, coming up in summer of 2021!\n<br><br>\n#### Some history\n\n- In 1998, I was born in the wonderful tropics of the Philippines.\n\n- In 2000, my parents and I immigrated to the United States for a brighter future.\n\n- In 2012, I took my first programming class (because my parents told me to) and surprisingly really enjoyed it. Go Java.\n\n- In 2014, I was chosen to represent THS at the national [HOBY](https://www.hoby.org/) seminar, which gave me my first real sense of leadership.\n\n- In 2015, I suffered through seven AP classes which sucked at the time but paid off later!\n\n- In 2016, I graduated high school and started my first year at the University of Maryland, where I was admitted into the [ACES Program](https://aces.umd.edu/)\n\n- In 2017, I took some really cool algorithm courses, served as a leader in UMD's Student Government Association, and went skiing for the first time.\n\n- In 2018, I started &TECH in my college apartment (channeling my start up vibes here), after realizing how much I could do and help others with creating opportunities for themselves in tech. Namely kids like my cousins in the Philippines, who are incredibly smart and just need an outlet to apply.\n\n- In 2019, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Math, got awarded [best undergrad TA](https://twitter.com/umdcs/status/1150774946521632768?lang=en) by the UMD Department of Computer Science, traveled to the Philippines, started my big girl full-time job, and turned &TECH into an official LLC.\n\n- In 2020, I pivoted to technology strategy, adjusted to the #wfhlife, and hiked a lot. Oh, and I put together an [amazing &TECH team](https://www.andtechnology.org/our-team.html)!\n<br><br>\n#### I like\n- Dancing (tap and ballet are my favs)\n- Snow\n- Hiking (Raven Rocks is currently my fav)\n- Baking\n- Working out\n- Books\n- Grey's Anatomy\n- r/AskReddit\n- Denver Nuggets (only cause they remind me of chicken nuggets)\n\n#### Fun facts\n\n- I have a notebook of nearly a hundred ideas, like Go Go Grocery or MindBar.\n- I played the drums at open band night at Cafe Nola after playing for only 2 months. Lol.\n- I religiously try to improve my chocolate chip cookie recipes by making them healthier but still tasty.\n- I plan to open up a wedding planning business in 2042 under the alias Katrina Mae.\n- I was a guest on super cool podcast, Keys to the Future, hosted by a dear friend and mentor.\n\n#### I dream of\n\n- enabling opportunities for more people.\n- always finding cool ideas.\n- doing good.\n- opening up a dance studio with my younger sister one day.\n",h=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,l=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(r.b,Object(o.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(d.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Katrina Delos Reyes",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(r.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(s.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:l},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
